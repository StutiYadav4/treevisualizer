# TreeVisualizer
This is a repository wherein I have uploaded the files of my Tree Visualizer project built using Data Structures and Algorithms to simulate Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees using Python and HTML (Javascript).


Requirements:
1. Python 3.x/ Visual Studio Code
2. Flask (pip install flask)
3. Flask-CORS (pip install flask_cors)
4. A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
5. Live Server extension in VS Code or any live server tool


Steps to Run Locally:
1. Start the Backend Server by running the command in Terminal - python backend.py. This runs the Flask backend on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

2. Start the Frontend (Tree UI) - Open treeui.html in Live Server


🌳 What This Project Does:

  This is an interactive Tree Visualizer for:
    ✅ Binary Search Tree (BST)
    ✅ AVL Tree (self-balancing BST)
  

  💡 Features Available on Your Local Browser:
    1.🔄 Insert keys dynamically
    2.❌ Delete nodes from the tree
    3.🔍 Search any key with visual animation
    4.👁 Visualize tree structure using D3.js
    5.📊 Run Traversals with animations:
    
      1.Inorder
      2.Preorder
      3.Postorder
      4.Level-order
    
    6.🌗 Toggle Dark Mode
    7.🧩 Fully syncs with the Python backend in real-time
