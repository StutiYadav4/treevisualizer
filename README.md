# TreeVisualizer
This is a repository wherein I have uploaded the files of my Tree Visualizer project built using Data Structures and Algorithms to simulate Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees using Python and HTML (Javascript).



Requirements:
1. Python 3.x/ Visual Studio Code
2. Flask (pip install flask)
3. Flask-CORS (pip install flask_cors)
4. A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
5. Live Server extension in VS Code or any live server tool



Steps to Run Locally:
1. Start the Backend Server by running the command in Terminal - python backend.py. This runs the Flask backend on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
2. Start the Frontend (Tree UI) - Open treeui.html in Live Server

  This is an interactive Tree Visualizer for:
    ✅ Binary Search Tree (BST)
    ✅ AVL Tree (self-balancing BST)  



  💡 Features Available on Your Local Browser:
      1.🔄 Insert keys dynamically
      2.❌ Delete nodes from the tree
      3.🔍 Search any key with visual animation
      4.👁 Visualize tree structure using D3.js
      5.📊 Run Traversals with animations:    
        1.Inorder
        2.Preorder
        3.Postorder
        4.Level-order    
      6.🌗 Toggle Dark Mode
      7.🧩 Fully syncs with the Python backend in real-time
